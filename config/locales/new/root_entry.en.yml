          The stories's permalink will be updated automatically. If
          the story is already published, a redirect from the old URL
          to the new ULR will be created.

          Used for requests to the root path with one of the above
          CNAMES. Once the site has been created you can also
          configure an entry as homepage.
        home_url_hint_html: |
          Used for requests to the root path with one of the above
          CNAMES. Alternatively, you can also use an entry as homepage.
          <a href="%{choose_url}">Select existing entry</a> or <a
          href="%{new_url}">create a new one</a>.
        home_url_with_root_entry_hint_html: |
          At the moment, the site uses the entry <a
          href="%{entry_url}">%{entry_title}</a> as homepage. Change
          the permalink of the entry to instead use the redirect URL.
