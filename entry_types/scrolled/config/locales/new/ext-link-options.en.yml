              label: "Thumbnail aspect ratio"
              inline_help: |-
                Determine the proportions of the thumbnails. If the
                text is displayed next to the image, longer text may
                result in a more portrait-like aspect ratio so that
                the thumbnail covers the entire height of the link.
            textPosition:
              label: "Caption"
              inline_help: |-
                Arrangement of image and text within links.
              values:

              inline_help: |-
                Intensity of the color gradient that is placed behind
                the text to improve contrast on busy backgrounds
            thumbnailSize:
              label: "Thumbnail width"
              inline_help: |-
                Proportion of the thumbnail width relative to the
                overall width of the link.
              values:
                small: "Small"
                medium: "Medium"

            thumbnailFit:
              label: "Thumbnail fit mode"
              inline_help: |-
                If the image's aspect ratio doesn't match the selected
                thumbnail ratio, you can either zoom the image to fill
                the card completely (which may crop it), or scale it
                down to fit within the card entirely (which may leave
                empty space).
              values:
                cover: Cover
                contain: Contain
            linkWidth:
              label: "Link width"
              inline_help: |-
                Choose a narrower width to arrange more links
                side by side.
            linkAlignment:
              label: "Link alignment"
              inline_help: |-
