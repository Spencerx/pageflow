              The title of the chapter appears in the navigation
              bar. It is also used to create the part of the web
              address that helps link directly to that chapter.<br><br>

              For example, if your chapter is titled 'Our Mission,'
              the system will create a web address like
              yourwebsite.com/story#our-mission, so
              people can jump straight to that chapter
